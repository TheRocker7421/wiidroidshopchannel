# Wiidroid Shop Channel
A remake of Nintendo's Wii Shop Channel for Android.
This is where you can download a variety of WiiWare, Virtual Console, and more.
To download a game just tap the title of the game, then tap Download. That's it! The game will start downloading to your Downloads folder.
Please feel free to ask questions in the issues section.
Also feel free to request ROMs for me to add to the application.
